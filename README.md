This project is a web-based spreadsheet application that mimics the core functionalities of Google Sheets, focusing on:
   A familiar spreadsheet UI (toolbar, formula bar, and cell grid).
   Drag-and-drop functionality for cells, formulas, and selections.
   Basic mathematical and data quality functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and REMOVE_DUPLICATES.
   Data entry, validation, and formatting options (bold, italic, font size, color).
